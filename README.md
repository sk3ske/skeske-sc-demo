This is a Crazy Cool C-C-Crypto Code Corroborator!

It is built on top of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Usage
-
To *run* the app in development mode, run `npm start` inside the top-level folder. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in a browser.

To *deploy* the app, use the command `npm run build`, which will build the app to the `build` folder. This will bundle React in production mode and optimize for performance.
